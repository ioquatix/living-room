# Modular Couch

This repository includes several designs for a modular couch system.

## Motivation

My living room is compact and normal furniture doesn't fit well. I decided to build my own furniture in a modular way that would suit our specific size requirements.

## Parts Required

- 42x42mm timber.

## Instructions
